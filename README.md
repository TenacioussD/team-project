#Initialising will also create a readme.md file. Use this to record important information about your project, such as a description, contacts for the project, keys, style guide, and instructions for new users on how to get started with the project.

Use section headings when writing in your md files, so that GitHub can automatically create a table of contents for your file. Section headings also have links so that you can link directly to any section heading.
